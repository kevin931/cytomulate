# cytomulate
CyTOF Simulation: When in doubt, cytomulate it!

## Project Dashboard

Check out our new [project dashboard](https://github.com/kevin931/cytomulate/projects/1). 

## Unit Testing

We will be using ``pytest`` for unit testing (talk to Kevin if this is an issue or if there are justifications for other solutions). Let's strive for 100% test coverage eventually! To get started, you will need to install the following packages:

```
pytest
pytest-mock
pytest-cov
coverage
```

To run our tests, we currently support the following:

```shell
python -m pytest . --cov
```

If tests don't pass at this stage, it's okay. Kevin will be catching up on writing tests and talking with the team on what works and what not. The instructions will be updated shortly once the package is installable so that we can test accordingly.
