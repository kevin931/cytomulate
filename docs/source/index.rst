Cytomulate: Accurate and Efficient Simulation of CyTOF data
#############################################################

Cytomulate is a package to simulation realistic data for Mass Cytometry or Cytometry by Time-of-Flight (CyTOF).
We support both model-based through **Creation Mode** and real-data-based simulation through **Emulation Mode**.
Cytomulate serves as solutions to benchmarking, method validation, prototyping, and more. You can easily generate
realistic and accurately CyTOF simulations within seconds.

Using our unified framework compatible with `PyCytoData <https://pycytodata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_,
you can stay within our ecosystem: starting from simulation to precessing, you can then select the best dimension
reduction method for your dataset and proceed onto other downstream analyses. All you need is a few simple commands!
For more details, **read our tutorials and documentations linked below!** Or try this example:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from cytomulate import CreationCytofData

   >>> cytof_data = CreationCytofData()
   >>> cytof_data.initialize_cell_types()
   >>> expression_matrices, labels, _, _ = cytof_data.sample(n_samples = 100)

**When in doubt, Cytomulate it!**
