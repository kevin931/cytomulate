Wecome to Cytomulate's Documentation!
======================================

Cytomulate is a package to simulation realistic data for Mass Cytometry or Cytometry by Time-of-Flight (CyTOF).
We strive to achieve both model-based and real-data-based simulation as solutions to benchmarking,
method validation, prototyping, and more.

When in doubt, Cytomulate it!
