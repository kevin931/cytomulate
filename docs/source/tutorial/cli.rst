Cytomulate CLI
#######################

We offer a concise and yet powerful Command-Line Interface (CLI) for those
who prefer shell scripting or running some simple simulations without
having to write Python code. Here you will find some examples and
tutorials on how to use ``cytomulate`` in this context and how you can
customize it to your needs.

*********************
Arguments and Flags
*********************

Admittedly, the CLI mode is not as feature-rich as the full API, but there
is still plenty you can do. Here, you will find a list of all arguments
and flags at your disposal:

``--make_new_dir``            General          None          ``False``   Whether to create the directory provided.
=========================== =============== ============== ============ ==============================================

If that table look a bit cryptic to you, don't panic! Here a few explanations.
The **Mode** indicates in which context you should use such arguments: the
**General** arguments are for both modes. Some arguments come with defaults,
making them completely optional, but for those that don't (as indicated by None),
you should provide the specifed type.

Now, we're going to explore how you can use these with examples and details.

------------------------------

*************************
Creation Mode
*************************

This is by far the easiest mode. The bare minimum is to specify ``--creation`` to start
along with ``n_cells`` for the number of cells per batch and ``-o`` the output directory:

.. code-block:: shell

    pyton -m cytomulate \
        --creation \
        --n_cells 1000 \
        -o <your_dir_here>

And the following three files will be saved to the directory you specified:

- exprs.txt
- cell_types.txt
- sample_index.txt

which are ``tsv`` files that are quite self-explanatory.

.. note:: 

    The first row of ``exprs.txt`` is the channel names. But for the cell types
    and sample index, the first row is not header.

You can also have a bit more customization by specifying the details of your samples:

.. code-block:: shell

    pyton -m cytomulate \
        --creation \
        --n_cells 1000 \
        --n_batches 2 \
        --n_types 5 \
        --n_markers 20 \
        -o <your_dir_here>

This will generate two batches with 1000 cells, 5 cell types, and 20 markers. Both
batches will be combined and saved to a single file, but the ``sample_index.txt``
will delineate the indices accordingly.

If you wish ``cytomulate`` to create the directory you entered, you can add
the following flag:

.. code-block:: shell

    pyton -m cytomulate \
        --creation \
        --n_cells 1000 \
        -o <your_dir_here> \
        --make_new_dir


This is how easy creation mode is!

--------------------------

**********************
Emulation Mode
**********************

This mode is slightly more involved because you need to specify the file and
cell types so that the model can emulate it. However, this is not as hard as
it seems:

.. code-block:: shell

    pyton -m cytomulate \
        --emulation \
        --n_cells 1000 \
        -o <your_dir_here> \
        --exprs <you_path_to_exprssion_matrix> \
        --cell_types <you_path_to_cell_types>


If your reference exppression matrix and cell types are both tab separated
without a header, then this example is **all you need**. However, if your
files are saved differently, you can customize the IO process accordingly:

.. code-block:: shell

    pyton -m cytomulate \
        --emulation \
        --n_cells 1000 \
        -o <your_dir_here> \
        --exprs <you_path_to_exprssion_matrix> \
        --exprs_colnames \
        --exprs_delim , \
        --cell_types <you_path_to_cell_types> \
        --cell_types_colnames \
        --cell_types_delim ,

Here we've indicated that both files' first rows are the column names
and they are comma separated. These are both pretty standard. If your
files are saved in other formats or your cell types are saved with
your expression matrix, you will need to preprocess them separately
and save to these cytomulate-supported formats accordingly.
